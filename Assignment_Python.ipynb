        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a general-purpose programming language that is popular because it is easy to learn, versatile, and has a large community of users. It is used in many industries, including web development, IoT, and desktop GUI programming.\n",
        "\n",
        " Python is popular due to-\n",
        " - Easy to learn: Python is considered beginner-friendly and has many tools to help beginners learn.\n",
        " - Versatile: Python is used in many industries, including web development, IoT, and desktop GUI programming.\n",
        " - Large community: Python has a large community of users and many resources available.\n",
        " - Efficient, reliable, and fast: Python is considered efficient, reliable, and fast compared to other coding languages.\n",
        " - Libraries and frameworks: Python has many libraries and frameworks that save time and effort during development.\n",
        " - Cross-platform compatibility: Python has cross-platform compatibility with library-like tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        " - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages like C or C++, which are converted into machine code before execution, Python is an interpreted language. This means that the interpreter reads Python code, analyzes it, and executes it directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        " -  A keyword refers to a predefined word that python reserves for working programs that have a specific meaning, You can’t use a keyword anywhere else.\n",
        " - A keyword can specify the type of entity.\n",
        " - All the keywords except ‘True’, ‘False’, and ‘None’ start in lowercase letters.\n",
        " - A few examples of Python keywords are: True, False, else, import, finally, is, and global\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        " - No, you cannot use keywords as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that define the language's syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, mutability is the ability to change the value or state of an object after it has been created. Mutable objects can be modified in place, which means that the original object is changed without creating a new one.\n",
        " - Examples- List, Dictionaries, Set.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists. Tuples can't be changed after they're created, but lists can be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, the == operator compares the values of two objects, while the is operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example\n",
        "\n",
        "     ==\n",
        " - The equality operator compares the values of two objects. It returns True if the values are equal, and False if they are not.\n",
        "\n",
        "  is\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The identity operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. It returns True if the variables point to the same object, and False if they do not.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - Logical operators in Python are keywords that evaluate conditions and return a Boolean value (True or False). They are used in conditional statements and expressions to make decisions and control the flow of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        " The three logical operators in Python\n",
        " - And: Returns True if both operands are true\n",
        " - Or: Returns True if either operand is true\n",
        " - Not: Reverses the result of an operand\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        " - Type casting in Python is the process of changing a variable's data type from one type to another. It's also known as type conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "  We use type casting:-\n",
        " - Type casting makes Python code more versatile.\n",
        " - It ensures compatibility between different data types.\n",
        " - It allows for flexible operations and data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        " - Implicit type casting- Also known as type coercion, this is when a programming language automatically changes a value's data type. This often happens when a program is performing operations on values of different types.\n",
        " - Explicit type casting- Also known as type casting, this is when a programmer manually changes a value's data type. This is done using built-in functions or operators that the programming language provides.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        " - Conditional statements in Python control the flow of a program by executing code based on certain conditions. They help make code more efficient and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Examples of conditional statements\n",
        " - If: Executes a block of code if a condition is true\n",
        " - Else: Executes a different block of code if the if condition is false\n",
        " - Elif: Checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes different code blocks depending on which condition is true\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        " - In Python, elif is short for \"else if\" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        " - In programming, a for loop is used to repeat a block of code a known number of times, while a while loop is used to repeat a block of code an unknown number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        " For loop\n",
        " - A for loop is a control flow statement that runs a section of code repeatedly until a condition is met. It typically consists of an initialization, a condition, and an iteration statement.\n",
        "\n",
        " While loop\n",
        " - A while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        " - In contrast to a 'for' loop, which is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, a 'while' loop is ideal for situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on some dynamic condition.\n",
